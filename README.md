# Recording Checker
This is a recording check script that checks if the user is currently running any recording software in the background. This is useful for screensharing in the Minecraft community. DM me at lrxh#0001 if you have any issues or suggestions.

# Want to compile the src to an .exe yourself?

1. Download RecordinCheck.py and put it in a new folder.

2. After that, in the same CMD type
```pip install termcolor```

3. After that, in the same CMD type
```pip install pyinstaller```

4. In the same CMD, do
```pyinstaller RecordinCheck.py --onefile```

5. Now you should have multiple folders generated. Click on **Dist**, and inside there should be the .exe.


# Notes!

• The .exe will flag any antivirus.

• The .py file should never flag anything on any antivirus.
